an open-source, step-by-step guide designed to help medium and large companies adopt polymer material-extrusion-based 3D printing for end-use parts manufacturing

Today’s Desktop 3d printing creates an insane opportunity for upending not only parts of manufacturing, but also business creation. I’m not talking about prototypes; I’m talking about real finished goods close to the customer with iteration happening in real time, with great sustainability footprints and much faster product development. What do I mean by Desktop 3D printing? I mean using incredibly low cost, massively parallelizable 3d printers to deploy local manufacturing around the world. Nobody’s doing that, you say? Think again. Companies like Gantri, Signify & Zellerfeld are doing exactly that, both in B2C and B2B markets. Unfortunately going from zero to this kind of setup is hard. Most companies looking to get started down this route start by talking to printer manufacturers and buying a printer. Printer manufacturers want to sell you printers. That’s not going to get you very far. 

The MaterialShift Framework is an open-source, step-by-step guide designed to help medium and large companies adopt polymer material-extrusion-based 3D printing for end-use parts manufacturing. It provides a practical, actionable roadmap to identify opportunities, design for additive manufacturing, engineer the right processes, integrate 3D printing into existing workflows, communicate success, and build internal expertise.
With tools, templates, and real-world examples, MaterialShift ensures a seamless, scalable, and profitable transition to the next generation of low-capex, parallelized 3D printing systems, empowering organizations to unlock the full potential of additive manufacturing.

It’s meant to be: 

* A practical playbook with actionable steps, tools, and resources to guide organizations in actually implementing polymer material-extrusion 3D printing for production.
* A community-driven approach that evolves with contributions from industry users and experts, ensuring it stays relevant and innovative.
* A focus on end-to-end implementation: from hardware/software/material selection to change management, training, risk reduction, and profitability strategies.
