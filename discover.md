**Discover**

**Who are you?**
Despite the buzz, 3D printing in organizations is still new. Less than 1% of manufactured end use parts are 3d printed (I would guess this to be less than 0.00000001%, so I guess <0.1% is technically correct). So who are you? You might be a super experienced 3d printing enthusiast. In fact many 3d printing engineers in organizations go home and... do 3d printing. Or you might be a product evangelist trying to find new opportunities for your company. Or you might be a manufacturing engineer who's looking to rework their manufacturing process. For all these cases, materialshift is for you and Discover is where you should start. 

**Do not go out and buy a 3D printer.** 
It might be tempting now to go out and buy a new 3D-printer. A new shiny toy that the 3D-printer sales guy tells you that you need. Resist that urge. If you want to do something hands on at this point, and you don't have any 3d printing experience, sign up for a community makerspace course in 3d printing. If you want to know more what you can do to upskill, have a look at the **Grow** part of the MakeShift framework.
 
#realworldexample: One of the most experienced European 3d printing sales leaders I know taught himself 3d printing a decade ago from a community college course! This is a perfect place to start.

**Be aware of your constraints**
You're not looking to get a powderbed fusion machine. You're not looking to print with metals. You're not going to print huge sized parts. Be aware of the limitations and constraints of what you're getting involved in. Hardware wise we're looking at a ~$500 machine that can print parts 30cm x 30cm x 30cm out of a variety of functional materials from PLA to TPU. So when you're looking for opportunities, a shoe is a great product size, or a small jig in manufacturing. A giant metal housing for an outdoor electrical box might be a less good fit.

**Think materials first**
Our world is based on materials. From glass to metal to plastics. Plastics have a bad reputation - but in reality we wouldn't have our current civilisation without them. There are thousands of different material types. It's important to know what you can work with and what you can't. Don't restrict yourself to PLA - in fact I'd argue PLA is more or less useless in industry/product applications. Have a look at the full range of materials available, like PETG, PC, TPU. Learn why these are important. 

**Do some design thinking based exploration**
Design thinking exactly was designed for this kind of activity. It's about looking at the world around you and learning from it, with hypotheses. Your hypothesis is that somewhere around you in your organization, manufacturing setup, or market, is an opportunity for a product that is mass customized, local and fits to the constraints.
