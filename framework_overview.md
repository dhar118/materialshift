Framework

#I'll replace this with a mermaid diagram soon. For the moment this is very high level & will get more concrete with actions and learnings from the industry soon.

Discover --> Identify opportunities in products & manufacturing processes, or from your customers. 
Create --> Design for 3D Printing taking into account material needs, printer limitations etc..
Engineer --> Develop processes and process parameters iwth the right materials, printers & settings

Note - Create & Engineer are kind of like two peas in a pod. There's a lot of sharing between the two (although the skills & knowhow required are different)

Implement --> Integrate 3D Printing into existing or future manufacturing setups, at different scales. 

Share --> Communicate your 3D printing initiatives to internal & external stakeholders.
Grow --> Develop your people skills & capabilities to support your growth.

Note - Share & Grow are two underying frameworrks around scaling & getting help & building an ecosystem.
